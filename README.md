# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

Kaggle.com has opened a comtetion to predict the survival (survived or not) of a set of Titanic passengers. The competition can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

This project deals with the basic data exploration and training of models to find the optitmum Machine Learning model to predict which passengers survived of the test data set given by Kaggle.
